There are more than 60 different species of opossum, which are often called possums. 

A female opossum gives birth to helpless young as tiny as honeybees. 

When threatened by dogs, foxes, or bobcats, opossums sometimes flop onto their sides and lie on the ground with their eyes closed or staring fixedly into space. They extend their tongues and generally appear to be dead. 

Opossums are excellent tree climbers and spend much of their time aloft.
